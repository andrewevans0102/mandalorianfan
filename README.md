## Project Structure

This is a react application. It uses [redux that can be seen here](./src/redux).

The [util](./util) folder has some helper functions that I used to pull data from wikipedia.

The site is hosted with Firebase and can be reached at [mnandalorianfan.com](https://www.mandalorianfan.com).

The site's deployment uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## Contributing

If you'd like to add to this project, feel free to open a PR and I will review as soon as I can.

Additional tasks that I'm planning to do:

- create Jest unit tests for components
- add additional characters and vehicles
- refactor some of the pages to be [React higher order components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html)
- improve performance with automatically optimzing images
